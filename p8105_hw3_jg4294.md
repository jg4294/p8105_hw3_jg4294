### Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes.

##### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>% # 134 by 2, count all kind of aisles
  arrange(desc(n)) # arrange aisles by its amount, or reversely arrange(n)
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

  - There are a total of 134 aisles in the instacart online grocery
    service with most items ordered from ‘fresh vegetables’ aisle.

##### Make a plot

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle), # a diff order: mutate to factor
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n) # then, fct_reorder(var1, var2): reorder var1 by var2.
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +# google: ggplot rotate axis labels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) # just this,looks not bad
```

##### Make a table

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% # count product_name within the aisle
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% # min_rank() helps to rank the order
  filter(rank < 4) %>%
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>%
  # arrange(desc(n)) # rank as 123123123
  # arrange(rank): rank as 111222333
  knitr::kable() #printing table
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

##### Apples vs ice cream

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table)

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

  - On average, Coffee Ice Cream is ordered around 2:00 in the
    afternoon, and Pink Lady Apples is ordered about the noon.

### Problem 2

##### Load and tidy accelerometer data

``` r
acc_df = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    starts_with("activity_"),
    names_to = "activity_minutes", 
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity_amounts") %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_weekend = case_when(
      day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday") ~ "weekday",
      day %in% c("Sunday", "Saturday") ~ "weekend"),
    
    week = factor(week),
    day_id = as.factor(day_id),
    day = as.factor(day),
    activity_minutes = as.numeric(activity_minutes),
    activity_amounts = as.numeric(activity_amounts),
    weekday_weekend = as.factor(weekday_weekend),
    
    day = forcats::fct_relevel(day, c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
  ) %>%
  arrange(week, day)
```

The original accelerometer dataset has 36 observations and 1443 columns.
However, some of the variables are easy to understand. The tidy-version
of the accelerometer dataset has 50400 rows and 6 columns.

##### Tranditional analyses: create a table for totals

``` r
acc_df %>%
  group_by(week,day) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_amounts)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = day,
    values_from = total_activity) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = 'c')
```

| week |  Monday   | Tuesday  | Wednesday | Thursday |  Friday  | Saturday | Sunday |
| :--: | :-------: | :------: | :-------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :----: |
|  1   | 78828.07  | 307094.2 |  340115   | 355923.6 | 480542.6 |  376254  | 631105 |
|  2   | 295431.00 | 423245.0 |  440962   | 474048.0 | 568839.0 |  607175  | 422018 |
|  3   | 685910.00 | 381507.0 |  468869   | 371230.0 | 467420.0 |  382928  | 467052 |
|  4   | 409450.00 | 319568.0 |  434460   | 340291.0 | 154049.0 |   1440   | 260617 |
|  5   | 389080.00 | 367824.0 |  445366   | 549658.0 | 620860.0 |   1440   | 138421 |

Saturday seems to be the day that man has least activity amounts,
especially for the last 2 weeks. All the weekdays seem to have quite
similar activity amounts in general. Other trends might be difficult to
find throughout the table.

##### Create a plot showing 24-hour activity time courses for each day

``` r
acc_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = activity_minutes, y = activity_amounts, color = day)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = F) +

  labs(title = "24-hour Activity Inspection ",
       caption = "Data from accelerometer",
       x = "Hour",
       y = "Activity amounts") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18)) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(60,1440,60), 
    labels = as.character(c(1:24))) +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_jg4294_files/figure-gfm/Q2_plot-1.png" width="90%" />

We can see the trends for weekdays are quite tied together(except
Friday), which is more activities around 8am to 9pm. However, Friday has
the highest activity amounts around 11am, which is also the highest
activity amounts among the weekdays. Saturday seems to be the day that
has the least activity amounts among the week. Sunday has the highest
activity amounts around 9pm, which is also the overall highest activity
amounts among the week.
